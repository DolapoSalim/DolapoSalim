### 🌟 Welcome to My GitHub Wonderland! 🚀  

Oh hey there, curious coder! You’ve just stumbled upon my little corner of the internet—lucky you. Here, you’ll find a mix of brilliant ideas, half-baked experiments, and the occasional *"what was I thinking?"* commits.  

### 💡 Who Am I?  
A marine researcher who juggles AI, ecosystem stability studies, species recognition analysis, and Call of Duty —all while keeping my sanity intact. I play around with:  
- 🧠 **AI & Machine Learning** (Yes, I talk to neural networks more than humans.)  
- 🌿 **Ecosystem Monitoring** (Because nature deserves cool tech too.)  
- 🎥 **Multimodal Modeling** (Making sense of videos, images, and more.)  
- 📢 **Predictive Modeling** (Let's forecast that lottery ticket? Yuppie.)

### 🔥 What You'll Find Here  
✨ AI models doing their thing  
🌍 Environmental research meets tech
🤖 Cool projects (some functional, some… *"in progress"*)  

## 🚀 Wanna Collaborate?  
Slide into my DMs (a.k.a. **Issues & PRs**) or just lurk around—no judgment.  
If you break my code, at least be funny about it.  

🔗 **Follow, Fork, or Judge Silently.** Your call. 😏
